# To-do-list-in-cpp
Personal C++ project which simulates a to-do-list, with file creation and updating.

The program works by creating a simple user interface in the terminal, where the user can decide how to manage the tasks. The changes are then uploaded into a text file "todolist.txt". 

The supported user actions are: create a task, remove a task, remove expired tasks, switch a task from "pending" to "completed" (or vice versa), and order tasks. The tasks can be ordered by due date, by status, by priority or by title (alphabetical order). 

This was done mainly as a fun opportunity to apply OOP concepts and knowledge of the standard library.
